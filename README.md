# 🏡 Home Loan Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a home loan application will be approved based on applicant details such as income, loan amount, credit history, and other demographic/financial factors.  

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a machine learning model to classify loan applications as **Approved** or **Rejected**.  
- Help banks and financial institutions speed up the decision-making process.  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains applicant details such as:  
- Applicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Credit History  
- Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, etc.  

*(Dataset is not included due to size/licensing. Please use public datasets like Kaggle’s Loan Prediction dataset.)*  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📊 Approach
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved **XX% accuracy** in predicting loan approval.  
- Feature importance analysis showed **Credit History** and **Applicant Income** as key factors.
